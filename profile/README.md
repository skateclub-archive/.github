# Welcome to the skateclub Archive

Here you will find the source code to everything that powered the skateclub Launcher.

All encryption keys, logins, API tokens, etc. have been removed from the code. You'll have to set those up

With a little elbow grease, you should be able to get the backend up and running.

Keep in mind that some code in these repositories is incomplete as the announcement of the shutdown was very sudden for us too. We will NOT be making any updates to the source code. Any bugs, unfinished or messy code will have to be fixed by you.

Thank you for a wonderful week, skateclub Community <3 - Meerkat
