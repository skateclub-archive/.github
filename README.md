# Welcome to the skateclub Archive

Here you will find the source code to everything that powered the skateclub Launcher.

With a little elbow grease, you should be able to get the backend up and running.

Keep in mind that some code in these repositories is incomplete as the announcement of the shutdown was very sudden. We will NOT be making any updates to the code. Any bugs, unfinished or messy code will have to be fixed by you.

Thank you for a wonderful week, skateclub Community <3
